        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Good Site: <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a></h3>
            <p>The Apple Website provides users with a slick layout to purchase and browse incoming products for the company. 
                Apple provides options to look at their different products such as the Iphone, Imac, and Ipad. The site features high-quality visuals, intuitive navigation, and a minimalist design that emphasizes simplicity and elegance. With a focus on branding and a seamless user experience, Apple’s website effectively highlights its products while maintaining a clean and organized layout.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple’s website uses strong contrast between text and background, ensuring readability. The combination of bold product images against clean white or dark backgrounds makes content visually appealing and easy to distinguish.</li>

                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Maintains consistency in fonts, colors, and layout across all pages. The repeated use of white space, sleek typography, and high-quality imagery reinforces brand identity and provides a cohesive user experience.</li>

                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The website follows a strict grid structure, ensuring that text, images, and buttons are neatly aligned. Each section flows smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements, such as product descriptions and purchase buttons, are grouped closely together, making navigation intuitive. The spacing between sections helps separate different categories while maintaining a seamless browsing experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Bad Site: <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist.com</a></h3>
            <p>The Charlotte Craigslist website is a local online classifieds platform where users can buy and sell items, find housing, look for jobs, and connect with the community. The site features a simple, text-heavy layout with categorized listings for easy browsing. While it prioritizes functionality over design, it remains a widely used resource for local transactions and services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong> The site employs minimal contrast, primarily using a white background with black and blue text. This design is functional but lacks visual appeal, making it challenging to highlight important information effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> While this repetition aids in usability, the absence of varied design elements can make the browsing experience monotonous.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The website utilizes a left-aligned, grid-based structure. However, the dense arrangement of text and links can lead to a cluttered appearance, making it difficult for users to quickly locate specific information.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related categories and links are grouped together, which is beneficial for navigation. Nonetheless, the close proximity of numerous links without adequate spacing can overwhelm users, hindering efficient information retrieval.</li>
